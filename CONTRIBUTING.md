# Contributing

The standard library has greatly flourished due to amazing feedback, pull requests and issue reports. Bugs and anomalies have been fixed and documented. We highly appreciate any PR with fixes or improvements. However a few points of advice:

* Please keep PRs as small as possible to allow for easier review and faster merging
* Make sure you follow the [Coding Conventions](https://wurstlang.org/manual.html#coding-conventions)
* Anything that isn't too deeply linked to WC III game logic should be unit tested
* Expect there to be requests for changes and suggestions by different members

If further natives need to be implemented for compiletime, they can be requested via a Feature Request.

Feel free to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/mSHZpWcadz) if you would like to contribute.
