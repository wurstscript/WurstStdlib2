/**
 * Dummy casters are commonly used in custom spells to cast abilities dynamically onto targets or points.
 * For example hexing all units in an AoE, or impaling in multiple directions.
 * If your spell's effect is entirely instant, you should use `InstantDummyCaster`.
 * For many spells however, InstantDummyCaster is not feasible, because they
 * 	 - are of type impale or channel
 *   - attach effects to the caster, like chain lightning
 *	 - deal delayed damage (fireball, shockwave)
 * In all of these scenarios the unit has to stand in a place and the spell's effects are not instant.
 *
 * DummyCaster uses one dummy per cast, and only removes it after a set delay, to allow effects and damage to process
 * Example with long delay for blizzard:
 *
 *		new DummyCaster()
 *			..origin(casterPos)
 *			..owner(caster)
 *			..delay(15)
 *			..castPoint('A000', 1, OrderIds.OrderIds.blizzard, target)
 *
 * The dummy caster will be recycled automatically, after the last spell's `delay` duration has expired.
 * You shouldn't destroy the object yourself. Just cast any amount of spells at once or shortly after and leave it.
 * Allocate DummyCasters dynamically on the spot and don't save them.
